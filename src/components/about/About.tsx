        <p className="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-4">
          I am a recent graduate of the University of Lynchburg, where I double
          majored in Computer Science and Data Science, earning a Bachelor of
          Science degree, along with a minor in Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-4">
          During my academic journey, I developed a deep understanding of
          algorithms, programming languages, and data manipulation techniques.
          Through various projects and internships, I gained hands-on experience
          in developing software solutions and extracting valuable insights from
          complex datasets. My double major in Computer Science and Data Science
          has equipped me with a unique skill set that combines technical
          proficiency with analytical thinking.
